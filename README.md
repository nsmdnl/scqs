# scqs - Simple container queries

scqs is a lightweight package [insert size here] for emulating [Container Queries](https://wicg.github.io/container-queries/) in order to style elements based on their own dimensions instead of the ones of the viewport.

## Installation

You can either download the file `dist/scqs.min.js` and embed it locally or install it via yarn/npm:

```bash
yarn add scqs
# or
npm install scqs
```

## Usage

## Embed

Embed it via script tag:

```html
<script src="path/to/scqs.min.js"></script>
```

or import it in your file like this when using a JS Framework:

```js
import "node_modules/scqs/dist/scqs.min.js"
```

## Define queries

You can define `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height` and `max-height` media queries for each element by adding the following attributes, of wich each can also have multiple values:

```html
<!-- Width -->
<div data-cq-min-w="400, 800"></div>
<div data-cq-max-w="1200"></div>
<!-- Height -->
<div data-cq-min-h="300"></div>
<div data-cq-max-h="800, 1000"></div>
```

When the conditions apply to each element, the attribute `cq-{min/max}-{w/h}-{breakpoint}` is added to the element.

```html
<div data-cq-min-w="400, 800" cq-min-w-400></div>
```

Then, you can style the element as you like with the [attribute selector](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_attribute_selectors.asp):

```css
div[cq-min-w-400] {
  font-family: "Comic Sans MS"; /* trolololol  */
}
```

## Browser support

scqs uses the modern **ResizeObserver API**, which is not supported by Internet Explorer (so sad! 😿).
It is gladly supported by modern browsers. You can look up its browser support on (Caniuse)[https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_resizeobserver]
